# front-end

A React app focused on CRUD operations, user authentication, and router navigation management.
State managed in the Redux store. 
A user can sign in as an owner or renter to engage in peer-to-peer tech gear rental.

This project was created with a team of 3. I was in charge of handling form functionality, form validation, route management and ui design.

The idea behind the site is a technology related renting service for those that wish to use a device for a temporary amount of time rather than own one.

You can also choose to rent your items out if you sign up as an owner account.

Technologies I used include 
-
* React
* React Router
* Material Ui
* Yup
* Axios
